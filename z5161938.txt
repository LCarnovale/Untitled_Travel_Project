Week 2

Group formed with Leo, Bryan and Kittipat. Added on facebook so we can communicate.

Decided that I (Ian) am the Scrum master and that we are going to do project 2.

Set up github repo (private, duplicated from the given repo) and added team members.

Leo set up a trello for us to organise work.

To do: Waiting on response from lecturer re: intro to existing software

Until then, read on the project details we've been given and start thinking about the epics/project scope.

After, we will designate work, next week's lab at the latest) we will start writing the document.
