Week 2

Group formed with Leo, Bryan and Kittipat. Added on facebook so we can communicate.

Decided that I (Ian) am the Scrum master and that we are going to do project 2.

Set up github repo (private, duplicated from the given repo) and added team members.

Leo set up a trello for us to organise work.

To do: Waiting on response from lecturer re: intro to existing software

Until then, read on the project details we've been given and start thinking about the epics/project scope.

After, we will designate work, next week's lab at the latest) we will start writing the document.



Week 3

Decision made to change to project 7, due to difficulties setting up project 2.
New repo set up.
Google doc set up for creating the proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5_uXV8AZ4QzptUo9QInDAijFSVfst84ZG21mW1tKek/edit#
Headings set up and planned at a high level, along with conceptual design of the website:
 - We want the website to be simple, user-oriented
 - We want it to be most accessible to people looking to book rooms, as this will be the most common type of user

Split up work for proposal:
- Background/aim - Kittipat
- Software architecture - Leo
- Planned Flow of website/design (frontend mostly) -  Bryan
- Technical details/Features - Ian
- Ad Epic - Kittipat
- Book Epic - Kittipat
- Search Epic - Bryan
- Review Epic - Leo
- Stand up/sprint schedule - Ian

Each person's sections should be done by THURSDAY NIGHT, and reviewed by everyone on FRIDAY before 11 (latest).
Cleaning up/Submission after 11 on friday (or earlier, time allowing)



Week 4

Switched to provided github repo (in the classroom, not our own private one)
Proposal completed and submitted (Monday)

Initial work split up:
 - Html (Ian/Bryan)
 - Flask interface (Leo)
 - Backend (Ince)

Aim is to make a very simple two-page website with the core features
 - Add new accommodation
 - Book accommodation

We will have another standup meeting on Monday, to see how people have gone and to work out which features to add next.



Week 5

Website was completed with ability to make and book accommodation
However, it currently only stores a name and description for each ad.

We have decided to include the following information for each place:
Name, Address, #Beds, #Bathrooms, Details of place, Owner name, Owner email/mobile, Owner description, Price (rate), Availability dates, Min/max stay (days), Additional rules.

In order to implement this, we have decided on the following workload split:

 - Booking page displays new info (Ian)
 - Posting an ad is a multi-stage form with new details (Bryan)
 - Backend stores new info (Ince)

Additionally, Leo has decided to look into azure databases and connecting them to the app.



Week 6

The website is now operational and hosted on azure. Everyone completed what they were supposed to for sprint 1, and the only task that was unassigned and incomplete is the ability to make a booking.

For sprint 2, we plan on finishing the above, as well as:
 - Setting up a more solid database schema and integrating it with the existing classes
 - Integrating google maps on frontend and backend
 - Implementing keyword search
 - Implementing advanced search (including search by location using gmaps)

To start the work is split up as follows:

 - Backend for keyword search (Ian)
 - Finalising DB schema (Leo)
 - Frontend for search (Bryan)
 - Booking backend (Ince)

If this goes smoothly, we will begin the google maps integration before the end of the week. If time allows, we will also consider implementing feedback/recommendations


Week 7

During this week, the following work was completed:

 - Advanced searching (mostly) - Ian
 - DB is finalised sans reviews - Leo
 - Calendar UI integration - Ince
 - Google maps API - Bryan

From now, we will start to work on picture uploading and review modules.

By next week we plan to have a working frontend, complete for all the current modules.
After that, we plan to polish the website and possibly add a web crawler, depending on what is complete by the end of the week.


Week 8

The presentation is actually happening in week 11 lab, not the week 10 lab like we thought. This has allowed us to do more work, and pace ourselves a little more.

We have dedicated week 10 to just be for testing and polishing, so all new features need to be done in this or next week.

For now, the work is split as follows:

 - Proper review module, as per proposal (Ian/Leo)
 - Starting to polish frontend (Ince)
 - Photo uploading finishing off/photo displaying (Bryan)

After that is done, we will think more about user flow, as well as adding extra features:
 - Web crawler
 - Dynamic search results
(Among other features we may choose to implement)

By Friday, I want to commit to master branch the up-to-date, working version of the software.


Week 9

The review module is now working, and progress has started on the web crawler. Photo uploading is complete and display is in progress (specifically, a nicer looking display). The front-end is looking better now, but is still in progress.

The distribution of tasks for this week are:

Leo:
 - DB: only reopen if >1min expired
 - DB: store for external site (acc has no owner id, and does have a link to external ad/poster)
 - Bookings per user page backend

Ian:
 - Backend: needs testing, bugs to be fixed and then merged to master and hosted on azure (Monday)
 - Crawler: Add another site

Ince:
 - Image: needs to display nicely
 - All website should be css-ready
 - Search results page should be HTML table

Bryan:
 - Booking page: needs gmap
 - Search page: main test box should be LOCATION search (that is, geolocate it ONLY), maybe add a keyword search text box in advanced search
 - If you have time, maybe start on a frontend page for displaying all the locations a logged-in user has made bookings for (as a list)

By next week, we will hopefully have all the intended functionality in place, and next week we intend to just test and make the front-end into the style that will be used for final presentation

We still do not know when the final report will be due, and so our workload next week will change depending on this information.



Week 10

The report is due week 11 tuesday, so we have plenty of time to finish it.

The web crawler is finished, and we have decided it will exist on a separate server instance so as to not have any synchronisation issues with the main server.

The only real things we have left to do (feature-wise) is to finish the web crawler (which we have opted to only have crawl airbnb for now), and to order search results better.

Other than that, a significant amount of work should be done on polishing the frontend, so Byran, Ince and Leo will work on that from now until friday. I will make sure everyone is in sync regarding the style. We plan to meet in person on friday at 2pm, so that it is easier to fix any last minute integration issues we may have.

As the scrum master, I will focus on starting the report and writing about group management and challenges/benefits of teamwork, as this was my main focus.


Small features we are working on:

Ian/Leo: Integrate crawler finally and get it running on separate server
Bryan: Variable distance slider, search scores/ranking backend, testing


Over the weekend, we plan to just test and write the report, as well as plan our demonstration based on the marking criteria.



Week 11

The website came together quite nicely, albeit with a couple of features thrown in at the last minute.

There were a couple features left undone, like advanced search highlighting and detection of duplicates in the web crawler. There were also some extra features we had to add at the end, like the ability to see the bookings for a user and the ability for an owner to see who has booked their venue.

The presentation went well, considering how things were a bit rushed leading up to it - we had to make some last minute fixes to our search functionality in order to be able to present, as it had somehow broken.


As of writing, we are about to submit the final code and report. They seem to have gone well, we found a few bugs we didn't know about before and have ironed them out. Also, we have spent a lot of time cleaning up the code:

Leo: base folder level python code and db/*
Ian: src/* (all other python code)
Ince: templates/* (all html code)
Bryan: static/* and templates/* (all javascript code)

The code is much nicer/easier to read now, and the majority of python functions have docstrings.


As for the final report, work was divided as follows:

Overview and Architecture (Ian)

Functionality/Challenges
 - Advertising module (Ince)
 - Booking module (Ince)
 - Search module (Bryan)
 - Review module (Bryan)
 - Crawler module (Ian)
 - Database module (Leo)

User Documentation and Manual
 - Setting up local server (Ian)
 - Using the site (Bryan)
 - Hosting on azure (Leo)
 - File structure (Ince)
 - File reference table (Ince)

Bibliography and Third-Party Software documentation (All)


I believe this has been quite a successful group project, and I am glad to have experienced it as a scrum master. Needing to organise the group brought its own set of non-coding challenges, and I am glad to say that for the most part, I overcame them.
