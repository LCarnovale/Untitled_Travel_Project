Week 3
    After complications in attempting to setup project 2 we decided to switch to project 7.
    A new repo has been made and the project proposal has been started.

Week 4
    Finished and submitted project proposal for project 7.

    Assigned tasks to each member. 

    I am working on flask and helping with the backend if needed.
    Aiming to have a minimal working backend version by next week.

Week 5
    Worked on setting up an Azure cloud storage database and server.

    Over the week I got a cloud storage service working and running and am now
    in the process of connecting to it through various api's from a python
    backend. 

    By Friday's meeting I have got an SQL database setup and have been able to
    read and write to the databse manually from my computer. Now working on
    modifying the database programatically.

Week 6
    Got a functioning database api that can connect to the database when run from the
    azure cloud based virtual machine. Now we need to complete the database and work
    on functions for querying it.
