Week 2
    Group formed.

    Created a trello group.
    
    Started project proposal, with some empty headings etc.

Week 3
    After complications in attempting to setup project 2 we decided to switch to project 7.
    A new repo has been made and the project proposal has been started.

Week 4
    Finished and submitted project proposal for project 7.

    Assigned tasks to each member. 

    I am working on flask and helping with the backend if needed.
    Aiming to have a minimal working backend version by next week.

Week 5
    Worked on setting up an Azure cloud storage database and server.

    Over the week I got a cloud storage service working and running and am now
    in the process of connecting to it through various api's from a python
    backend. 

    By Friday's meeting I have got an SQL database setup and have been able to
    read and write to the databse manually from my computer. Now working on
    modifying the database programatically.

Week 6
    Got a functioning database api that can connect to the database when run from the
    azure cloud based virtual machine. Now we need to complete the database and work
    on functions for querying it.

    Saturday:
    Databse has almost been finished and querying the database is working well with the api.
    Now need to work on getting the front end and backend working properly.
    Classes for representing users, venues etc. have been completed and
    are working well. I managed to make a booking on a venue from the website,
    which stored the relevant information in the database.

Week 7: 
    Website has a functional edit profile page, but there is still no way to log in as an owner.
    Will try add this functionality this week.

    Wednesday:
    Now it is possible to login as an owner. This will help with
    determining owners of new postings.

    Friday:
    Merged the current backend into Ian's search branch, will get that working smoothly then
    hopefully merge back into backend and/or master. Might have to fix some outdated
    references to class methods etc.
