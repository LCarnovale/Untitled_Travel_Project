Week 3
    After complications in attempting to setup project 2 we decided to switch to project 7.
    A new repo has been made and the project proposal has been started.

Week 4
    Finished and submitted project proposal for project 7.

    Assigned tasks to each member. 

    I am working on flask and helping with the backend if needed.
