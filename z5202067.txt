Week 2 
Formed group with Kittipat, Ian and Leo. Cloned the repo and joined the Facebook group.
While waiting for Ian's email to be replied, I am planning to run the OnTask and see how we can extend it for the project.
By next week, hopefully, we can figure out what needs to be done.

Week 3
Decided to change to project 7 instead because we might not be able to get OnTask running. 
We are starting the project proposal this week. I'll be working on the search module and the system designs.

Week 4
Decided to work on an MVP with only two modules. Me and Ian will be working on HTML. 

Week 5
Worked on the HTML files. Created a multiple form page, logo and home page.

Week 6 
Start working on advanced search which consists of the following: 2 calendar(start date and end date), number of people staying and a Gmap for location selector.

Week 7 
Worked on users logging in and google maps API. Mainly worked on displaying google maps and geocoding to get address in human-readable format

Week 8
Worked on Photo Uploading to a folder and storing the url in database
